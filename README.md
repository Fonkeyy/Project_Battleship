# Project_Battleship

## Project Overview
- This Battleship game project is a practical implementation of concepts learned in the [Odin Project Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship).

## üöÄ Learning Highlights
- **MVC Design Pattern**: Successfully applied the Model View Controller design pattern to organize and structure the codebase.
- **Computer Logic with Recursion** : Developed a computer logic system that leverages the last move before playing using recursive functions for strategic decision-making.
- **Drag and Drop Functionality** : Implemented a custom drag and drop feature to enhance user experience during ship placement.
- **Unit Testing with JEST** : Gained exposure to unit testing using JEST for robust code validation.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features
- **Play vs computer**: Engage in a challenging game against the computer.
- **Smooth Drag and Drop**: Seamlessly move and position ships using an intuitive drag and drop interface.
- **Random Fleet Placement**: Quickly start the game by placing your fleet randomly with a single click.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è Possible Features to add
